      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <p>
        He studied law at the National University of Colombia, but left it to
        dedicate himself to journalism and literature. In 1955, he published La
        Hojarasca, his first novel. In 1961, he settled in Mexico City. The same
        year he published The Colonel has no One to Write and the following year
        The Funerals of Mamá Grande. In 1967, he ordered the publication of One
        Hundred Years of Solitude in Buenos Aires, the work that established him
        worldwide. In 1972, he won the Rómulo Gallegos Prize and in 1982, the
        Nobel Prize for Literature. Other great works of his are The Autumn of
        the Patriarch (1975), Chronicle of an Announced Death (1981), Love in
        the Time of Cholera (1985) and News of a Kidnapping (1996). His memoirs
        were published in 2002 under the title of Vivir para Contarla. In his
        last years he suffered from lymphatic cancer, a disease that caused his
        death on April 17, 2014, in Mexico City.
