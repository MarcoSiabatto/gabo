        <h1>No One Writes to the Colonel</h1>
        <p>This novella is about an elderly colonel in Colombia during a time of martial law and his asthmatic wife. Their son, Augustin, is presumed dead, killed for passing out subversive literature at a cockpit. The colonel and his wife possess a rooster who is doted on by the other villagers. The townspeople are saving their money to bet on the rooster.</p>
        <p>As the story opens, the colonel is about to attend a funeral that is the first for a person who died of natural causes in many years. Every Friday, the colonel collects his mail, hoping for the arrival of his pension check, but it never arrives. Collecting his mail, he meets the local physician, who lends him the government-sanctioned newspapers. The physician comes to the colonel's house to treat the colonel's wife but refuses to take money for his services. He hands the colonel clandestine news in an envelope and asks the colonel to pass it along to Augustin's compatriots in the anti-government movement. Each week, the colonel goes to collect his pension, but he waits in vain, as he has been doing for fifteen years. Sixty years before, the colonel had been a revolutionary officer who had laid down his arms against the government.</p>
